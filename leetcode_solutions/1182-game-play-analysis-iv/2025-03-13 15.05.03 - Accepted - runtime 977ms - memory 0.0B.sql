/*
Find First Login Date:

The subquery SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) FROM Activity GROUP BY player_id gets the first login date for each player.
Check Next-Day Login:

We filter Activity where (player_id, previous dayâ€™s event_date) matches (player_id, first login date), meaning the player logged in the next day.
Count and Compute Fraction:

COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) counts players who logged in the next day.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity counts total unique players.
The fraction is calculated and rounded to 2 decimal places.
